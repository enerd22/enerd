        <h3> October 29, 2019 </h3>

          <p> I am officially starting a blog about my running.  I have wanted one for a while, but I am finally committing to see it through.  Right now I have taken the last two days off and then I'm back to training.  I have been training for about 6 months non stop and my Cross Country season has come to an end, but I still am running races with my buds.  I hope I survive the next month of all out tapering. </p>
